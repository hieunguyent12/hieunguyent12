Hi everyone! I'm a 2nd year student majoring in Computer Science at the University of Florida with a minor in Mathematics. My interests are __Fullstack Development__ and __Computer Graphics__ which I'm currently exploring. I'm proficient in __Typescript/Javascript, C++, Python__, and I'm also learning Rust and C. My personal/group projects are hosted here on Github so feel free to browse through them and let me know if you have any questions!

My proudest programming project is https://github.com/drpika1134/Game (I promised myself to eventually complete it at one point)
